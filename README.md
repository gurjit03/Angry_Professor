# Angry_Professor
The professor is conducting a course on Discrete Mathematics to a class of N students. He is angry at the lack of their discipline, and he decides to cancel the class if there are fewer than K students present after the class starts.  Given the arrival time of each student, your task is to find out if the class gets cancelled or not.
